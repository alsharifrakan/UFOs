## **Summary**


This is a basic page where you can get some UFO sightings infomration; however, it lacks some detailed informations such as the number of people who observed the sighting at 
that particular moment of time. Since we know that having as much relevant data as possible will make the page much better and more useful. Once we have more data available
such as how many people so the event and for how long we can certainly add more filters to make it easier to retrieve any information. Therefore I would recommend 1. collecting more data and 2. adding additional filters.
